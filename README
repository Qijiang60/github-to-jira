Github-to-JIRA
--------------

This script will use the Github API to get a dump of all of the issues in a
Github repository, and then put that in a CSV file which you can then use to
import into JIRA.

When doing the inport in JIRA, map the columns like so:

 * Title: Summary
 * Body: Description
 * Created At: Creation Time
 * State: Status (and then tick 'Map this type')
 * Comments X: Comment Body

Date format: yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm

Run it like so:

 ./github_to_jira.py user/repository issues.csv
